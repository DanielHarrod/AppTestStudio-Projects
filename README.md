# AppTestStudio-Projects

Minimal exports don't include the reference images, AppTestStudio will re-link the images when the application is run.  There's still a bug I'm chasing where the linker is aggressive.  After the re-linking is done you can save with the reference images reapplied.

### Instructions
Download the Zip file and Import with [AppTestStudio](https://github.com/DanielHarrod/AppTestStudio) which will have a wizard help pick out a project folder.

Or you can extract the zip file manually to a folder typically in the My Documents\App Test Studio\Project Folder\ and then open with [AppTestStudio](https://github.com/DanielHarrod/AppTestStudio).
