# AppTestStudio-Projects

Minimal exports don't include the reference images, AppTestStudio will re-link the images when the application is run.  

Object search currently doesn't rebuild the background images, however it's only used to set masks, thus not required, a screenshot will need to be taken on those so you can see the masks.

### Instructions
Download the Zip file and Import with [AppTestStudio](https://github.com/DanielHarrod/AppTestStudio) which will have a wizard help pick out a project folder.

Or you can extract the zip file manually to a folder typically in the My Documents\App Test Studio\Project Folder\ and then open with [AppTestStudio](https://github.com/DanielHarrod/AppTestStudio).
