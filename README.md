Projects created with https://github.com/DanielHarrod/AppTestStudio

Run the projects or use them for inspiration.

Running the projects will need to match the monitor resolution that they were created under.
AppTestStudio currently does not suppport monitor scaling, set monitor scaling to 100% on the monitor that the application will be running under.
Windows -> System -> Display -> (Pick the monitor the target app will be running) -> Scale & Layout -> Scale -> 100%

Copy the project folder into your "Documents\App Test Studio" folder.
Typically "C:\users\(logged in user name)\Documents\App Test Studio"
Or Start-> Search for "Documents"
